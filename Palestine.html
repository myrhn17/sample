      <h1>Palestine</h1>
       
	  <h2>History Of Palestine</h2>
	  	<p>Palestine's history is rich and complex, dating back thousands of years. It has been inhabited by various groups, including the Canaanites, Philistines, and Jews, and has been ruled by numerous empires, such as the Egyptians, Romans, Byzantines, and Ottomans. After World War I, the League of Nations assigned Britain the mandate to govern Palestine, during which time the Balfour Declaration of 1917 supported the establishment of a Jewish homeland in the region. This period saw increased Jewish immigration, which led to rising tensions with the Arab population.</p>

      <h2>Conflict</h2>
		<p>The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has roots in competing national identities and claims to land. After the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip, further deepening the conflict. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) emerged as a key player, advocating for Palestinian rights and statehood. Efforts toward peace, such as the Oslo Accords in the 1990s, aimed to establish a framework for resolving the conflict but ultimately failed to deliver lasting peace. Tensions have since escalated, with frequent cycles of violence, military operations, and political strife continuing to shape the conflict.</p>

      <h2>Effects of the Conflict</h2>
		<p>The conflict has devastating humanitarian consequences for Palestinians, particularly in Gaza, where repeated military operations have led to extensive casualties, destruction of infrastructure, and a blockade that restricts access to basic needs. Reports indicate severe impacts on health care, education, and living conditions, contributing to widespread poverty and trauma among the population. Additionally, the conflict perpetuates a cycle of violence and instability in the region, affecting not only Palestinians but also Israelis and neighboring countries, as tensions continue to rise.</p>

      <h2>Current Situation</h2>
		<p>Israel had ordered an airstrike against Palestine (specifically Gaza), as a way to get Hamas out of hiding. The ongoing conflict has devastated the civilian population of Gaza. Seventy-five percent of the population of Gaza has been displaced, most multiple times, and the entire population is in need of humanitarian assistance. The ongoing conflict, bombardment, and blockade have led to catastrophic humanitarian suffering for more than 2 million Palestinians—half of them children—who are now without clean water, food, and vital medical services.</p>
		<p>There were also many reports and articles about Israeli soldiers brutally murdering or torturing innocent civilians for no apparent reason. Right from the start, the IDF extended attacks well beyond Hamas’s paramilitary units. Schools, hospitals, water treatment plants, and the like were all early targets, as were journalists, aid workers, and medical staff. The Islamic University is just one of two Palestinian universities (along with Birzeit in the West Bank) to make it into world rankings, and it was bombed less than a week into the war. Since then, every university in Gaza has been destroyed or damaged.</p>
